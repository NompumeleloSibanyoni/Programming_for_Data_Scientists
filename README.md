# Programming for Data Scientists (COMS5022A)

Mini Python projects developed as part of **Wits Postgraduate Diploma in Data Science**.  
This repository demonstrates the use of **functions, conditionals, loops, and user input** in Python.

---

## 🧠 Overview
These small projects illustrate how programming logic underpins data science automation and analytics workflows.  
They serve as a foundation for understanding control flow, modularization, and debugging.
